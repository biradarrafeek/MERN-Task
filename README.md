# Task Management Application

The Task Management Application is a comprehensive tool designed to help users efficiently handle their tasks. Built using __React__ for the frontend, **Node.js and Express** for the backend, and MongoDB for the database, it allows users to **create, read, update, and delete** tasks. Each task includes a title, description, status, and due date, and the application features sorting and filtering options to enhance usability.

On the frontend, the TaskForm.js component provides a form for both creating and updating tasks, with responsive design achieved using **Tailwind CSS**. The form uses useNavigate for navigation after submission and dynamically adjusts based on whether an ID is provided. The TaskDetailView.js component displays detailed information about a selected task and allows for editing, while the TaskListView.js component lists all tasks with options to **filter** and **sort** them, and includes functionalities for creating, updating, and deleting tasks.

For the backend, the application utilizes Node.js and Express to create a **RESTful API**. The API includes endpoints for **fetching** all tasks, retrieving a specific task by ID, creating new tasks, updating existing ones, and deleting tasks. It features robust input validation and error handling to ensure reliable operations.

The MongoDB database, managed using **Mongoose** for object data modeling, stores tasks with fields for title, description, status, and due date, providing a structured approach to data management.

This setup results in a responsive, feature-rich task management tool that efficiently handles user tasks and provides a smooth user experience.


================================================

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
